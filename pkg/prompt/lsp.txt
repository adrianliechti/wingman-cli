Interact with Language Server Protocol (LSP) servers to get code intelligence features.

Supported operations:
- definition: Find where a symbol is defined
- references: Find all references to a symbol
- hover: Get hover information (documentation, type info) for a symbol
- implementation: Find implementations of an interface or abstract method
- documentSymbols: Get all symbols (functions, classes, variables) in a document
- workspaceSymbols: Search for symbols across the entire workspace
- incomingCalls: Find all functions/methods that call the function at a position
- outgoingCalls: Find all functions/methods called by the function at a position

Most operations require:
- file: The file to operate on (absolute or relative path)
- line: The line number (1-based, as shown in editors)
- column: The character offset (1-based, as shown in editors)

The workspaceSymbols operation requires:
- query: The search query for symbols

Note: LSP servers are auto-detected based on project files. If no server is available for a file type, an error will be returned.
